# alt:V scratch module

Have you ever wanted to use the greatest programming language ever created on alt:V? Well now you can!

## Installation
Because I am lazy to add releases you have to build this shit yourself (look below)\
Once you built it place all of the files in dist folder into modules/scratch-module folder, it has to be named like this otherwise it won't work

## Building
You need to have Python, CMake and VS 2019 installed for this\
Just run the build.bat file and it should take care of everything

## How to use
If you want to use this amazing module you can do it by creating project on [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), doing some amazing coding and then saving it, then create a resource and set the main file as the .sb3 file\
You need to name the sprite where all of your code will happen "Sprite1" exactly like this otherwise it won't work

# And now some amazing FAQ

## Why did you do this
Idk

## How does it work
Do I look like I know, I copied [this](https://github.com/scraterpreter/scrape) edited it a little and made it into alt:V module

## Can you access alt:V API with this
First I wanted to add support for at least logging but I was too lazy to do it

## I found a bug can I report it
I don't fucking care

## Why can't you run it on linux
Linux doesn't like scratch

## Why do you need Python for this
The thing which translates the scratch magic into json is written in Python and I don't have the brainpower to rewrite it into C++
